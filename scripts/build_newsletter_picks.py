"""Generate newsletter-picks.json — collection quotes that have been featured in
the Quote Unquote newsletter ("As seen in Quote Unquote").

Cross-references newsletter-issues.json against the collections: an issue's
quote is matched to a collection quote when their normalized texts (lowercased,
alphanumerics only) contain one another. Matched collection quotes are emitted
with a `newsletterIssue` number and a `sourceCollection` back-reference. Not
every newsletter quote maps to a collection quote — many issues are about
misattributions/paraphrases with no verified entry in the dataset; those are
reported and skipped.

**Only issues with `status: "sent"` are eligible.** The log also carries the
backlog and the scheduled-but-unsent, and a quote badged "Quote Unquote #7" for
an issue no subscriber has received — and no reader can open — is a claim the
newsletter has not earned yet. Quote Unquote has not launched, so today this
feed is empty by construction.

When nothing qualifies the feed is **not written**, and any existing copy is
removed. An empty feed file is worse than an absent one: build_manifest.py lists
each feed only when its file exists, so absence propagates cleanly (the website
drops the shelf, the app drops the tile), whereas a file with `quotes: []` still
draws an empty "From Quote Unquote" tile in the app, which gates on the feed
being present rather than on it having contents.

Standalone like the other generated feeds: NOT registered in collections.json
and outside collections/. Deterministic output. Stdlib only.

Usage: build_newsletter_picks.py [--root ROOT] [--out PATH]
