"""Generate search-index.json — every quote in the dataset, flattened into one
searchable document, plus the author roster derived from it.

The index exists because `collections.json` carries only two `previewQuotes` per
collection — 166 of 2,711 quotes, about 6%. A client searching what it already
has would miss the rest, and would return different results depending on which
collection files happened to be cached. One flat file makes quote- and
author-level search answerable offline, from a single fetch, with the same
results for everyone.

Each entry carries the field names the collection files use, so a consumer that
already decodes a collection quote can decode these with the same type. The
`sourceCollection` back-reference joins to `collections.json` for presentation
(name, colour, icon) — deliberately *not* duplicated here, so a palette or rename
change ships in the index alone and can't disagree with this file.

Standalone like the other generated feeds: NOT registered in collections.json and
outside collections/, because it reuses other collections' quote ids and text.
Deterministic output — re-running with unchanged data produces no diff. Stdlib only.

Usage: build_search_index.py [--root ROOT] [--out PATH]
